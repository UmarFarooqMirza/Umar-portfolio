                    <h3>Tic-Tac-Toe Game</h3>
                    <p>This project is a <b>Tic-Tac-Toe Game</b> built using <b>React</b> and enhanced with <b>Framer Motion</b> for smooth animations. It provides an interactive and visually appealing experience while maintaining the core mechanics of the classic game.
        
                        The game is played on a <b>3x3 grid</b>, where two players take turns marking the squares as <b>'X'</b> or <b>'O'</b>. The state of the game is managed using React's <b>useState</b> hook. The game logic checks for a winner after each move by evaluating predefined winning combinations. If all squares are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
                        
                        The UI includes a dynamic turn indicator, a responsive game board, and an animated winner announcement. The game features a <b>reset button</b> to start a new match instantly. <b>Framer Motion</b> is used to animate elements, creating smooth transitions and effects when the game state changes.
                        
                        This project demonstrates the power of React for state management and UI updates while incorporating animations for an engaging user experience.</p>

                    <h3>Candy Crush Clone</h3>
                    <p>This Android project is a simplified version of the popular <b>Candy Crush</b> game developed using <b>Java</b> and the <b>Android SDK</b>. The app features an <b>8x8 grid</b> made with <b>GridLayout</b>, where each block is randomly filled with colorful candies. Players interact with the game by swiping the candies in four directions—left, right, up, and down—to match three candies of the same color in a row or column. The core game logic includes <b>drag-and-swap mechanics</b>, <b>candy matching</b>, <b>score tracking</b>, and <b>automatic refill of blank slots</b>. The game continuously checks for valid matches using a <b>Handler</b> and runs at a fixed interval to update the board state. If three candies match, they disappear, the score increases, and the candies above fall down to fill the gaps. The remaining empty slots are filled with new random candies to keep the game dynamic. This project demonstrates effective use of <b>event listeners</b>, <b>UI manipulation</b>, and <b>logic-based gameplay</b> in Android development, providing a solid foundation for building interactive and engaging mobile applications.</p>

                    <h3>Dynamic Quiz Web</h3>
                    <p>
                        This project is a <b>dynamic quiz web application</b> developed using <b>Node.js</b> and <b>Express.js</b>, with <b>EJS</b> as the templating engine. It focuses on delivering a smooth user experience by allowing users to attempt quizzes and instantly view results. The app architecture follows the <b>MVC (Model-View-Controller)</b> pattern, where all quiz logic is managed inside the <b>quizController</b> module. 
                        
                        It serves static files from the <b>public</b> directory and utilizes <b>body-parser</b> middleware to handle form data. Users land on the <b>home page ('/')</b>, navigate to the <b>quiz page ('/quiz')</b> to attempt a test, and are then redirected to the <b>results page ('/result')</b> after submission. The core logic handles rendering quiz questions, processing answers, and evaluating results.
                        
                        This project helped strengthen my skills in <b>server-side routing, form handling, middleware integration</b>, and <b>template rendering</b>. It's a strong example of building a real-world application using Express.js and is easily scalable for features like database integration, user authentication, and score tracking.
